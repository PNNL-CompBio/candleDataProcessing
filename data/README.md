### Data Description

This directory stores the data files and tools needed to wrangle the files. They can be easily downloaded from this GitHub site or the scripts can be run remotely. The data processing for CANDLE falls into two primary parts. The aggregated data schema, which stores all the data for training/test/validation and the model-specific data, which uses the aggregated data 

### Data Schema

The data schema for the aggregated data is shown below.

As we generate model data, list models and scripts here.
